   <h3>A graphics processing unit <br>
 (GPU) is a specialized electronic<br>
 circuit designed to rapidly manipulate <br>
and alter memory to accelerate the <br>
creation of images in a frame buffer <br>
intended for output to a display device. <br>
GPUs are used in embedded systems, <br>
mobile phones, personal computers,<br>
 workstations, and game consoles. <br>
Modern GPUs are very efficient at <br>
 manipulating computer graphics and <br>
image processing. Their highly parallel <br>
 structure makes them more efficient <br>
than general-purpose central processing <br>
units (CPUs) for algorithms that <br>
 process large blocks of data in <br>
parallel. In a personal computer, <br>
a GPU can be present on a video <br>
card or embedded on the motherboard. <br>
In certain CPUs, they are embedded <br>
on the CPU die.[1]</h3>
   <br> have fun. :)
